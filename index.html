			 	<h2> Who Am I? </h2>
                <p>Most of my time is spent coding, writing, creating art, and building things. My areas of expertise are data science, democracy, education tech, and visualization.

                Right now, I am a PhD student at University of Colorado - Boulder in the Computer Science Department working under <a href="www.tomyeh.info">Tom Yeh</a>.  I also do work with <a href="www.fastforwardlabs.com">Fast Forward Labs</a>, specifically on their Deep Learning report and research. Outside of these affiliations, I am the co-founder of an organization, CoLab, that has varied interests across our members, though generally education technology, art, public science, and sustainable living/design tend to be at the forefront.

                If you <strong>really</strong> want to know my passtions, a more exhaustive list of my interests would be: writing (fiction and non-fiction), education and teaching, art, coding, manual labor, music, agriculture, building things, community, law, and democracy.</p>

			 	<h2>Current Projects</h2>
			 	<ol>
			 		<li><strong>Quantified Self Art Show</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>I received a gracious grant from University of Colorado's "Engineering Excellence Fund" to put on an art show around our relationship to the data we create</li>
			 			<li>The first run of the show will be April 12-17, 2016 in Boulder,CO in the ATLAS Institute's Blackbox Theater</li>

			 		</ul>
			 		<li><strong>ModuLearner</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>With CoLab, we are working to create a free, modular online textbook that is centered on project-based learning. We also are working on a platform that uses this content to help teachers and learners design curriculum that is centered on project-based approaches</li>
			 			<li>If you are interested in learning more or think you'd like to contribute to our text go to our <a href="www.modulearner.com">project page</a>.</li>
			 		</ul>	
			 		<li><strong>Students for Instructional Improvement</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>Right now, I am leading a senior project team of computer science undergraduates at CU-Boulder. Our task it to create a student-focused alternative to our university's survey system that we used to collect data on classes each semester</li>
			 			<li>Our belief is that we've largely gathered the wrong data about classes, and if students should have a direct voice in shaping what kind of data collect, and also be able to access and use that data easily.</li>
			 			<li>We hope to have a version of our site up by the end of 2015</li>
			 		</ul>
			 		<li><strong>Democracy in the Digital Era</li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>Right now I am teaching a new course at Colorado called, "Democracy in the Digital Era" which relates historical and contemporary issues of democracy to their new context of information and digital media.</li>
			 		</ul>
			 	</ol>

			 		<li><strong>Code</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>I am extremely bad at keeping up with code documentation, but as my projects get appropriately documented, I will link them on this site.</li>
			 			<li>All of my code is open-source and can be found <a href="www.github.com/wannabeCitizen">on my GitHub Account</a>.  My language of choi
