## Who Am I?
Dodging the philosophical question for the moment, the most recognizable role I have is as a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Student status aside, I am the co-founder of a small non-profit organization named CoLab.  Some of my life interests are writing (fiction and non-fiction), education, coding, manual labor, the arts, agriculture, community, and democracy.  I hope one day, when I'm old, I can say I'm good at some of these things!


## What you'll find here.

1. #### Writing
	+ **Fiction** is mostly short stories, but I also plan to keep a working draft of my first novel on here.
	+ **Non-fiction** includes academic essays, opinion pieces, and possibly in the near future some educational content (i.e, tutorials).  I'll do my best to tag them so people know what to expect.  Citation styles will vary pending on whom they were written for.

2. #### Code
	+ I mostly code in Python and JS, but am gaining more Web Development skills.
	+ A lot of my code is done for research
	+ My coding interests are normally for some mix of educational technologies, data science, and "things that think."

3. #### Research Projects
	+ At CU-Boulder, I currently do work in both the Computer Science and Education Departments. 
	+ I am a member of [Sikuli Lab](lab.sikuli.org), and my primary advisor is [Tom Yeh](http://tomyeh.info/)
	+ My advisors in the Education School are [Ken Howe](http://nepc.colorado.edu/author/howe-kenneth-r) and [Andy Maul](http://www.colorado.edu/education/people/andrew-maul)
