#What is this?
In due time, this page will host all of my writing (fiction, non-fiction, and academic) as well as my code.

But for now, it's a work in progress...

## Who Am I? 

I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Colorado - Boulder in working in [Sikuli Lab](lab.sikuli.org)
I also am a co-founder of the non-profit CoLab.
