&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;The Bit-Wise Soul of the 21st Century&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project was to create a compelling experience from data coming from sensors placed under mats at the entrance of CU&amp;rsquo;s Atlas lobby. Every ten minutes, the sensor count resets. The balls on the screen represent the number of times the sensor has been hit since th last reset. The bottom left times represent sensor counts from previous hours and bottom-right times represent predictions for the next two hours based on the average from past days. Notes that compose various scales and melodies compiled by Brian Newsom play as a sensor is stepped on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visualization also plays through an interactive story written by Mike Skirpan and conceptualized/implemented by Mike Fyk that branches based on the number of sensor steps. If the number of sensor steps in a story phase is greater than the average for that hour of the day, the story continues differently than if the number of steps is less. The full story is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio and Server Implementation: Brian Newsom and Ian Ker-Seymer
Hardware: Adrian Chen
Visuals: Mike Fyk
Story: Michael Skirpan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Start of Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was walking in a hurry through the lobby.
Data traveling into her ears and eyes.
The glow of her retina display shining back.
Then, a soft voice lilted through the noise of her earbuds, barely audible above the beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;First PATH A: [More people stepping]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling her earbud out, she turned to notice a boy shaking his head, sobbing at a nearby table.
His laptop had just crashed, and his final project was lost.
&amp;ldquo;What am I supposed to do now? This is what I get for trusting a computer,&amp;rdquo; he lamented.
She approached him and asked, &amp;ldquo;Are you okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATH A/A: [More people stepping]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.  Wish I could go back an hour and back up my data,&amp;rdquo; he replied.
She smiled and put her hand on his shoulder, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t even imagine.  During final&amp;rsquo;s week, too.&amp;rdquo;
He gave back a warm smile and felt relieved to have someone sharing in this frustrating moment.
&amp;ldquo;Things could be worse,&amp;rdquo; he said.
&amp;ldquo;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t change how it feels.  Here let me buy you a coffee,&amp;rdquo; she offered.
The two went onward smiling, leaving their technology behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATH A/B: [Less people stepping]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m fine. Tired of my crappy computer,&amp;rdquo; he answered sternly.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s better than writing everything on paper,&amp;rdquo; she kidded.
&amp;ldquo;Easy for you to say.  Why don&amp;rsquo;t you joke with someone else?&amp;rdquo; he replied.
Only hoping to help, she walked away stunned and thought about how she think twice next time she thinks to chat with a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATH B: [Less people stepping]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the beat went on and she missed the tragedy happening only inches away.
Captivated by her Facebook feed, she remembered she had promised her friend, Taylor that she would accept her party invite.
A house-warming party that only 10 people had accepted on Facebook, it was her duty to show support.
Clicking &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; she thought about the three other events she had agreed to that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATH B/A: [More people stepping]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She remembered how Taylor had been there for her when her rent check bounced.
The other parties suddenly seemed less appealing compared to supporting her true friend.
Closing Facebook, she tapped out a text message to Taylor.
&amp;lsquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ll def be there on Saturday - I&amp;rsquo;ll bring a bottle of red.&amp;rsquo; She texted.
Putting her phone away she smiled and walked onward to class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATH B/B: [Less people stepping]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing through the other events for Saturday, she saw one hundred people were going to Travis&amp;rsquo; party.
The pictures from Travis&amp;rsquo; last party looked like a blast - selfies with scattered laser light in the background.
Already forgetting about Taylor&amp;rsquo;s party, she accepted the invite to Travis&amp;rsquo; and turned up some house music in her ears.
Fantasizing about the weekend, she entered her class dreaming of something only movies had promised her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy in the Digital Era - Fall 2015 @ CU-Boulder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Weds 3-5:30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor&lt;/strong&gt;: Michael Skirpan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Number:&lt;/strong&gt; ATLS 3519-001&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Course Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this course is to do side-by-side examinations of historical and contemporary challenges, movements, and transformations in American Democracy.  In particular, we will emphasize how technology and information access are changing the current landscape of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course hopes to attract a hybrid class of engineering and humanities students in order to leverage the skills of each group toward interactive workshops and cross-disciplined final projects.  While there will be some prepared readings, topics, and workshops, the class will be run in a democratic fashion such that students have a lot of control to choose topics, field trips, workshops, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, be prepared to participate but also to have your voice heard and interests taken seriously in shaping the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Class Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class time will be split into two sections with a break in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of seminar will be spent going over concepts and frameworks, and having engaged discussion based on the week&amp;rsquo;s homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half will be a hands-on workshop.  Students will be able to request certain workshops, but these will be intended to have students learn together and from one another in a hands-on way.  Workshops may include designing a policy solution, creating a website, having a guest speaker come to whom we can ask questions, going on a field trip, drafting a letter to a Congressman, planning a public art project, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Work Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be weekly readings, but they will be light (minimum 10pgs, maximum 50pgs; pending other work happening).  Class participation during discussion will be important so readings will be expected to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students will each be expected to help design one of the workshops.  Your work toward this will be part of your grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be final projects that will also count for a large part of your grade.  Due to this, work load for the rest of class will trim down later in the semester.  These projects will be done in chosen groups and should address one of the topics we covered in class.  They are flexible and could be anything from: a web application that proposes a solution for a problem we discussed, a piece of art, preparing and hosting an event (such as a panel discussion), an essay, a short story, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Potential Topics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the class is going to be dynamic to student interests some topics that I have prepared are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State Secrets: Comparing Edward Snowden&amp;rsquo;s Revelations to Frank Church&amp;rsquo;s fight agains J. Edgar Hoover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate Personhood: Citizen&amp;rsquo;s United and SpeechNow.org vs. FEC in contrast to the early protections given to corporations in the late 1800&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protest: Occupy Wall Street in light of historical unionized protests (e.g., railroad workers in late 1800&amp;rsquo;s, Congress of Industrial Organizations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting Rights and Participation: Considering the restriction of voter&amp;rsquo;s rights historically (racial restrictions, gender restrictions) in comparison to today&amp;rsquo;s Voter ID laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tragedy of the Commons: The crisis of individual agency in a world filled with well-known problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Further Questions or Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more questions about the course or need help petitioning it to count toward something, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections on Dewey and the Pursuit of Democracy</title>
      <link>http://mwskirpan.com/blog/dewey-and-democracy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://mwskirpan.com/blog/dewey-and-democracy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the tiniest sliver of the American population who still manages political action via large sums of money, it is a commonly held belief that our system of democracy has become unable to function properly.  Stating this platitude is about all we as citizens have been able to do; actionable responses are still pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of movement is not a lack of ideas given the constant influx of articles being published by academics and journalists that offer critique and sometimes even solutions.  We saw one large-scale attempt at reinvigorating a public movement to change democracy with the 2011-12 Occupy Wall Street movement, which – while still extant in small factions – mostly deteriorated as police cracked down on protests and media attention waned.  Currently, one major living attempt to stimulate federal change is Lawrence Lessig’s MayDay PAC and his march across New Hampshire.  It’s important to place these movements in our short-term memory before discussing the otherwise dearth of collective action happening in a nation with widespread discontent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having tipped my hat to these yeomen of civil dissidence, I see a need to address the ailments of the larger population to understand our national complacency in light of a seeming widespread desire for change.  The fire underneath my words was kindled upon returning to read John Dewey whose prescience regarding the future course of democracy is both inspiring and depressing.  Reading him gives us insight into the historical nature of our national problems, yet reminds us how little progress has been made improving the process of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dewey tells us a common story with his pithy explanation of why certain members of our voting population-—many of whom may now be sympathizers with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution&#34;&gt;comedian Russell Brand’s current active voice&lt;/a&gt;—-see no reason to vote or work within the system to change such a large corrupted animal as, say, Congress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;the cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy is not apt if it means that the evils may be remedied by introducing more machinery of the same kind as that which already exists, or by refining and perfecting that machinery.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point here being that if contemporary democratic systems are not working, we cannot pile our resources into those same systems in their current form and expect a new result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a different angle, our citizenry who sit back and perform their perfunctory duties in hopes of a magical change often are guilty of making a particular assumption that was clear to Dewey in 1946 already seeing a population forgetting democracy is something in which we participate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;we have more or less unconsciously assumed that the work of establishing a democracy was completed by the founding fathers or when the Civil War abolished slavery. We tend to think of it as something that has been established and that it remains for us simply to enjoy.&amp;rdquo; [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to diagnose a problem in education: teaching democracy without it taking its usual course within the experience of the learner.  The Civil War and The Declaration of Independence are inculcated as static symbols we count on for renewing our faith that we do, indeed, live in a democracy; even when we are encountered by paralyzing trends such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens%20homepage%20materials/Gilens%20and%20Page/Gilens%20and%20Page%202014-Testing%20Theories%203-7-14.pdf&#34;&gt;coporate-controlled legislative system&lt;/a&gt; compliments of lobbying and revolving-door politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrasting view would be that democracy can only be taught as a process you must take an active role in to keep it afloat, and thus learning its concepts would require participatory activities.  Not only would this experiential approach to learning democracy fit with Dewey’s educational philosophy, but it is also compatible with his view that democracy itself must be reestablished anew by each generation of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to explain why these two diametrically opposed groups cannot find the change they seek: one lacks a positive heuristic &lt;em&gt;to do&lt;/em&gt; anything and the other counts on an historical romance to justify complicity with what manifests as dysfunction.  What takes a more nuanced explanation is, “why aren’t people, whose view of things falls between these poles, strategizing and acting on the problems in front of them?”  Again, Dewey offers insight into the range of reasons in a passage as apt in 2014 as it was in the 1920’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a social pathology which works powerfully against effective inquiry into social institutions and conditions. It manifests itself in a thousand ways; in querulousness, in impotent drifting, in uneasy snatching at distractions, in idealization of the long established, in a facile optimism assumed as a cloak, in riotous glorification of things ‘as they are,’ in intimidation of all dissenters—ways which depress and dissipate thought all the more effectually because they operate with subtle and unconscious pervasiveness.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dewey gives us some common imagery of a citizenry who has established habits of life dissonant with the needs of a living democracy.  This is the viral epidemic of a population taught how to take part in a society before having the chance to think about why to take part in one.  Someone with a strong belief in the power of ideas may rebut these pathological descriptions by pointing out the multitude of writers who are apt to inquire against our social institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appropriate Dewian response is to point out that this is not effective inquiry.  Building knowledge is a crucial function of research and study, but merely collecting information tied to no action is another symptom of having learned about society’s problems without this knowledge being conjoined with personal experience.  Critical minds are just as easily coerced into the habits of the time, and it should come as no surprise that “thinking deprived of its normal course takes refuge in academic specialism,&amp;rdquo; [2].  In academia we are taught that the modus operandi of a progressive thinker is to respond to jargon-ridden articles, and thus we get an enclave of bright minds fighting conceptual battles in lieu of collective participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it should be asked whether there is any central thesis here beyond taking stabs at our collective apathy.  The purpose of contextualizing Dewey within the current democratic scene is to appeal to the same worry he had many years prior: that we will turn up fruitless in the search for “The Great Community.”  His play on the idea of “The Great Society” seems to shine light on the fact that no matter how powerful and advanced we become, if we do not learn to cooperate as a community of actors against the challenges of the time, we risk being swept up by the current – stripped of any agency to change humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today our social schematic demands we pursue our dreams in the narrow realm of a career; chased after alone or in pairs while other pursuits take a backseat.  Most often those who choose to break any such cultural habit is named a &amp;lsquo;radical&amp;rsquo; or is taken to be delusional.  Without a univocal ‘we’ to voice our demands, each of us drifts as an ‘I.’  Isolated, our fear of losing the game of success precludes us from the patience it takes to produce new meanings in our labor and life.  Community is watered down by convenience.  Change is something you wait for rather than create.  Choosing to live in a way that deviates from our deepest cultural habits places you on the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dive into Dewey one last time in hopes of emerging with a better sense of what it takes to be a community, a way out of these traps.  For we as a people to begin the process of winning back a democracy, and thus a public, recognizable as our own—-whether that is in the case of schools, elections, labor unions, welfare, or community businesses—-it is mandatory we learn the ability to work in a communal manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wherever there is conjoint activity whose consequence are appreciated as good by all singular persons who take part in it, and where the realization of the good is such as to effect an energetic desire and effort to sustain it in being just because it is a good shared by all, there is in so far a community.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this definition, we may see ourselves as a part of many communities, but must be careful to ask yourself to what extent these communities are born out of convenience or comfort.  Further, would we be choosing to express ourselves in this manner without the draw of money.  The harder challenge comes out of the second half of Dewey&amp;rsquo;s definition of community: finding and participating in a group activity that you energetically want sustained, rather than something that produces a malaise or is brazenly critiqued when your honest opinion is disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to begin taking part in the process of changing anything, we must first learn how to act in unison toward worthy goals.  The problem of democracy is as much a problem of a fractured public as it is one of corruption.  Relating our context to the one Dewey was writing within, it’s worth mentioning that the quotes regarding community were written about 2 years before the start of The Great Depression.  Now it appears that our challenge as citizens is to not become too distracted, delusional, or entrenched in the status quo to seek more effectual modes of cooperation.  Enacting change is and always will be something done rather than thought or spoken, and, in order to budge a system as large as ours, we must learn to act in waves instead of droplets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aaron Swartz Panel Discussion</title>
      <link>http://mwskirpan.com/blog/internets-own/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2014, I was part of a panel discussion that followed a showing of &amp;ldquo;The Internet&amp;rsquo;s Own Boy&amp;rdquo; - a documentary about Aaron Swartz&amp;rsquo;s life and prosecution.  The panel included two law professors who specialize in the fields of privacy and computer law, one open-source hardware designer and advocate, and one computer scientist and advocate (a/k/a me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The footage of the panel can be found for free &lt;a href=&#34;http://classcapture.colorado.edu/Mediasite/Catalog/Full/5dbf4ddd76ce43f1a7d3ee5b2ba765e321&#34;&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI: You may need to fast-forward slightly as it was recorded by an automated camera that started a bit before the panel got going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interactive Data Installation at CU-Boulder</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Everyday Data: An Interactive Data Installation in CU-Boulder&amp;rsquo;s ATLAS Lobby Space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Autumn of 2014, with the hard work of the students in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://csci-4830-002-2014.github.io&#34;&gt;HCC: Big Data&lt;/a&gt; class, I oversaw a large art installation that combined both the technical and aesthetic aspects of large-scale data collection.  The installation was the culminating project of our upper-division class on the subject, and its implementation was supported generously by a grant from CU-Boulder&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://eef.colorado.edu&#34;&gt;Engineering Excellence Fund&lt;/a&gt; along with my advisor &lt;a href=&#34;http://tomyeh.info&#34;&gt;Tom Yeh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial goal was to create a way to arrange the diverse skills in coding, music, visual art, and circuitry found across the class into a unifying project that would reach out beyond the confines of our classroom.  Beyond this, we hoped to turn a passive lobby space into an active interaction that would engage passerbyers, perhaps even away from their often attention-consuming technological devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After allowing the class to vote on whether they wanted to take on the project and then what pieces they hoped to implement, we ended up splitting into four teams.  Each team&amp;rsquo;s piece involved a hardware component and a visual component.  The hardware was mounted around the lobby to track and offer interactive material while all visualizations were on a rotating display broadcasted on the lobby&amp;rsquo;s giant 8ft x 6ft digital display.  Though hardware varied, all visual components were done using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.d3js.org&#34;&gt;JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s D3 package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of the four projects are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conversations in ATLAS Lobby&lt;/em&gt;: This team mounted two condenser microphones near the study tables in the lobby space and used them to record snippets of conversations in process.  The two microphones were connected to a hidden Raspberry Pi computer that converted the recordings into short .wav files that would be processed for semantic information and, words that were confidently inferred, stemmed to their root form.  Once the words were processed, they were saved into a MongoDB instance we had waiting in the cloud.  Finally words were tallied for their frequency and turned into a giant word cloud accompanied by a bar graph of the most frequent words and word stack showing what was currently being said near the microphones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/words_pic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;conversations&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Four V&amp;rsquo;s of Woz&lt;/em&gt;: An adaptation of Andy Warhol&amp;rsquo;s iconic repetitious block portraits, these students chose to replace Warhol&amp;rsquo;s Marilyn Monroe or Jackie Kennedy with a tech icon - Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.  In line with the pop-art imagery, each portrait of Steve Wozniak was filled with bright colors and a high-contrast backdrop.  Six images were displayed in succession, each one changing it&amp;rsquo;s color, brightness, contrast, and saturation parameters based on live data being collected from both the lobby space and around the internet (specifically, data related to CU-Boulder or Apple).  For more information, look to the group&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshferge.github.io/AboutWozPage/&#34;&gt;written explanation of their work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/woz_pic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;woz&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing Your Sound&lt;/em&gt;: Featuring a live equalizer, real-time graphing of decibel levels, and a daily average of the loudest and quietest times, this team&amp;rsquo;s work was a collection of visualizations compiled out of live data being collected from an ambient microphone hanging in above the heads of those in the lobby.  The microphone was connected to a Raspberry Pi mounted high above in the rafters.  From their the sound data was processed and converted both into a frequency spectrum of the sound samples and an average decibel reading over the sample period.  This data was pushed to a cloud-based MongoDB instance through over REST API then digested by JavaScript on the client side to create a live, visual feed of noise events happening in the lobby.  All visualizations ran in real-time and had immediate interactivity through a simple shout or loud noise.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bitwise Soul of the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt;: Currently this project uses force sensors taped under the floor mats placed at all the entrances/exits to the lobby to track the foot traffic moving through the lobby space.  As people walked through the lobby, the patter of their steps fed input into a multi-modal experience.  Starting with the force sensors feeding into an arduino, triggers were sent to a Raspberry Pi when any of the entrance/exit sensors were triggered.  Upon being triggered, a Japanese string instrument could be heard across the lobby space.  Along with this audio experience, a visualization displayed two coordinated facets of the project: particles entered and bounced around in a box as the sensors were stepped on more and a story was being revealed, one sentence at a time, that adapted to the number of people interacting with the sensors.  For a further write up of this project, read the [student write up]() of their project and full body of the story. &lt;em&gt;(This project is currently being updated to use Xbox Kinects for body sensing - this description will be updated when this is complete.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installation opened on December 11, 2014 at the ATLAS Expo and will remain on display through the Spring of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Making your own fractal trees&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, I am in an amazing class entitled Chaotic Dynamics by a wonderfully edifying instructor - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/&#34;&gt;Liz Bradley&lt;/a&gt;.  Last week when we were studying fractals, I went a bit overboard and wrote a Javascript application that builds a Cantor-like set and then allows you to see the result of the set as a tree which has fractal properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please play around with it &lt;a href=&#34;http://mwskirpan.com/FractalTree/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas of how to extend this, please do get in touch.  You can expect to see a lot more interesting visuals and projects in the coming months based around chaotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of the fun you can have:

      <title>How Neural Networks Learn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending a summer with Fast Forward Labs researching Deep Learning, I decided to make a visualization that would help others get some of the insights I did about the notion of learning in neural networks. For now I am simply going to direct you to the other places where my post lives. From there you can link to the interactive visualization and read the full post.&lt;/p&gt;
