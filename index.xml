      <title>Reflections on Dewey and the Pursuit of Democracy</title>

      <description>Beyond the tiniest sliver of the American population who still manages political action via large sums of money, it is a commonly held belief that our system of democracy has become unable to function properly. Stating this platitude is about all we as citizens have been able to do; actionable responses are still pending.
This lack of movement is not a lack of ideas given the constant influx of articles being published by academics and journalists that offer critique and sometimes even solutions.</description>

      <title>Aaron Swartz Panel Discussion</title>

      <description>On October 20, 2014, I was part of a panel discussion that followed a showing of &amp;ldquo;The Internet&amp;rsquo;s Own Boy&amp;rdquo; - a documentary about Aaron Swartz&amp;rsquo;s life and prosecution. The panel included two law professors who specialize in the fields of privacy and computer law, one open-source hardware designer and advocate, and one computer scientist and advocate (a/k/a me).
The footage of the panel can be found for free at this link</description>

      <title>Everyday Data: An Interactive Data Installation in CU-Boulder&#39;s ATLAS Lobby Space</title>

      <description>In the Autumn of 2014, with the hard work of the students in our HCC: Big Data class, I mentored them in creating lobby art installation that combined both the technical and aesthetic aspects of large-scale data collection. The installation was the culminating project of our upper-division class on the subject, and its implementation was supported generously by a grant from CU-Boulder&amp;rsquo;s Engineering Excellence Fund along with my advisor Tom Yeh.</description>

      <title>Fractal trees in D3</title>

      <description>Making your own fractal trees At the time of writing, I am in an amazing class entitled Chaotic Dynamics by a wonderfully edifying instructor - Liz Bradley. Last week when we were studying fractals, I went a bit overboard and wrote a Javascript application that builds a Cantor-like set and then allows you to see the result of the set as a tree which has fractal properties.
Please play around with it here</description>

      <title>How Neural Networks Learn</title>

      <description>After spending a summer with Fast Forward Labs researching Deep Learning, I decided to make a visualization that would help others get some of the insights I did about the notion of learning in neural networks. For now I am simply going to direct you to the other places where my post lives. From there you can link to the interactive visualization and read the full post.

      <description>The Bit-Wise Soul of the 21st Century The objective of this project was to create a compelling experience from data coming from sensors placed under mats at the entrance of CU&amp;rsquo;s Atlas lobby. Every ten minutes, the sensor count resets. The balls on the screen represent the number of times the sensor has been hit since th last reset. The bottom left times represent sensor counts from previous hours and bottom-right times represent predictions for the next two hours based on the average from past days.</description>

      <description>Right now our organization is working to create a free textbook and curriculum planning tool to support teachers in designing active classrooms that give their students authenic voices in shaping their learning experience.
You can read more about our project on our website.
If you are interested in helping us deliver high quality educational content to teachers, consider contributing to our textbook. We are currently looking for scientists, educators, artists, engineers, and makers who would like to write a module for our textbook.</description>
