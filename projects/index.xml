      <description>Right now our organization is working to create a free textbook and curriculum planning tool to support teachers in designing active classrooms that give their students authenic voices in shaping their learning experience.
You can read more about our project on our website.
If you are interested in helping us deliver high quality educational content to teachers, consider contributing to our textbook. We are currently looking for scientists, educators, artists, engineers, and makers who would like to write a module for our textbook.</description>
