After spending a summer with Fast Forward Labs researching Deep Learning, I decided to make a visualization that would help others get some of the insights I did about the notion of learning in neural networks. For now I am simply going to direct you to the other places where my post lives. From there you can link to the interactive visualization and read the full post.
