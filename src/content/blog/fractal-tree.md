# Making your own fractal trees

At the time of writing, I am in an amazing class entitled Chaotic Dynamics by a wonderfully edifying instructor - [Liz Bradley](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/).  Last week when we were studying fractals, I went a bit overboard and wrote a Javascript application that builds a Cantor-like set and then allows you to see the result of the set as a tree which has fractal properties.

Please play around with it [here](http://mwskirpan.com/FractalTree/)

If you have any ideas of how to extend this, please do get in touch.  You can expect to see a lot more interesting visuals and projects in the coming months based around chaotic systems.

Here are some examples of the fun you can have:
