On October 20, 2014, I was part of a panel discussion that followed a showing of "The Internet's Own Boy" - a documentary about Aaron Swartz's life and prosecution.  The panel included two law professors who specialize in the fields of privacy and computer law, one open-source hardware designer and advocate, and one computer scientist and advocate (a/k/a me).

The footage of the panel can be found for free [at this link](http://classcapture.colorado.edu/Mediasite/Catalog/Full/5dbf4ddd76ce43f1a7d3ee5b2ba765e321)

FYI: You may need to fast-forward slightly as it was recorded by an automated camera that started a bit before the panel got going.
