                        With the support of the James S. and John L. Knight Foundation, I wrote and co-produced a performance meant to discuss issues of technology ethics with the public. Alongside a team of 45 engineers, artists, and dramatists constructed an immersive experience that allowed people to interact with and question their relationship with data. Each audience member witnessed a sci-fi drama, conversed with actors and the audience, and played with up to 12 interactive data exhibits.

                        <br>
                        Working directly with education researchers Daniel Reinholz and Niral Shah, and a multi-institutional academic team, I was the lead designer for the first version of an online app for observing classrooms. The goal is help teachers do formative assessment of their classroom - particularly around issues of equality. That is, are people of different ethnicity, gender, and class given equal opportunities in the classroom?

                        In collaboration with artist Maotik, we did a real-time simulation of the ocean using live information about weather and the tides. A LIDAR grid on the floor allowed us to track audience members and allow them to interact with a water texture displayed on the ground.

                        Modeled after the dynamics of firefly syncronization, this installation used 400 LEDs hanging to create a natural contour and show off the beauty of fireflies in the night. Run by a Raspberry Pi, a live simulation randomly started each firefly blinking at some frequency, then slowly they learned from one another until they became synchronized.

                        As an educational tool, while working at Fast Forward Labs, I made an interactive visualization to show the process of how neural networks learn. There's an accompanied blog posts that explains the visuals and attempts to lucidly discuss the complex system that is a deep neural net.

                        While exploring Cantor Sets and Fractal Dimensionality, I ended up making a fractal tree generator using D3.js. The little website allows you to make your own SVG tree with custom colors, sizes, etc. They are really beautiful!
