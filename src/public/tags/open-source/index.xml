      <title>Aaron Swartz Panel Discussion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2014, I was part of a panel discussion that followed a showing of &amp;ldquo;The Internet&amp;rsquo;s Own Boy&amp;rdquo; - a documentary about Aaron Swartz&amp;rsquo;s life and prosecution.  The panel included two law professors who specialize in the fields of privacy and computer law, one open-source hardware designer and advocate, and one computer scientist and advocate (a/k/a me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The footage of the panel can be found for free &lt;a href=&#34;http://classcapture.colorado.edu/Mediasite/Catalog/Full/5dbf4ddd76ce43f1a7d3ee5b2ba765e321&#34;&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI: You may need to fast-forward slightly as it was recorded by an automated camera that started a bit before the panel got going.&lt;/p&gt;
