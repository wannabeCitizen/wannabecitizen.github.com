			 	<h2> Who Am I? </h2>
			 	<p>Much as the tagline aludes, the majority of my work centers around writing and coding.  Two major motivational strands tend to pervade my work: <strong>education</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong>.  

			 	Currently, I am a PhD student at University of Colorado - Boulder in the Computer Science Department working under <a href="www.tomyeh.info">Tom Yeh</a>.  Also, I am the co-founder of a non-profit, CoLab, that currently focuses on free educational resources and sustainable living/design (with many other interests in the mix).

			 	Beyond formal categorizations of my work, a more exhaustive list of my interests would be: writing (fiction and non-fiction), education, coding, manual labor, the arts, agriculture, community, law, and democracy.</p>

			 	<h2> What You'll Find Here </h2>
			 	<ol>
			 		<li><strong>Writing</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>I am in the midst of working on a novel that I plan to have a full draft of by mid-2015.  I also have a number of short stories and other fictional romps that I will slowly add to this site.</li>
			 			<li>This site also hosts my blog which is nothing more than a free space for me to write out my thoughts on any number of the topics listed above.</li>
			 		</ul>
			 		<li><strong>CoLab</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>Projects from my non-profit will slowly make their way onto this site.</li>
			 			<li>Right now, we are working on creating a free online textbook and curricular resource for teachers wanting to make active classrooms for teaching science.  If you are interested in this project or think you'd like to contribute to our text go to our <a href="www.modulearner.com">project page</a>.</li>
			 		</ul>	
			 		<li><strong>Research</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>My PhD work is toward improved instructional models for teaching STEM content with hands-on and inclusive methodologies.  Further, I work toward pedagogical designs that promote democratic classrooms.</li>
			 			<li>Over time I will keep drafts of my papers, talks, and class content up to date.</li>
			 		</ul>
			 		<li><strong>Code</strong></li>
			 		<ul>
			 			<li>I am extremely bad at keeping good code documentation, but as my projects get appropriately documented, I will link them on this site.</li>
			 			<li>All of my code is open-source and can be found <a href="www.github.com/wannabeCitizen">on my GitHub Account</a>.  My language of choice is Python; though you'll also find some JavaScript, C, and Java floating around in there.</li>
			 		</ul>
